 
# Script to Secretly Copy Files from a USB Drive

This Python script is a tool that copies and backs up files on a USB drive to a specific hidden folder.
The tool can be used to back up data on the USB drive at certain intervals. However, the malicious use of this script is for unauthorized data copying and is strongly discouraged for use in illegal activities.
Users should only use this tool for legal and ethical purposes. Please use it only on your own USB drives and with legal permissions to ensure privacy and security of data.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met for this script to work:
- Python 3
- psutil library

To install the psutil library, you can run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

pip install psutil

## Usage

1. **Check Requirements:** Make sure you have installed the `psutil` library before running the script.

2. **Run the script:** When you run the script, you will get an appropriate message if the USB drive is not connected or inaccessible.

3. **When the USB Drive is Connected:** When the USB drive is connected, the script will copy the files on the drive to the designated destination folder.

4. **Copy Process:** The copy process will be repeated at certain intervals (5 seconds by default).

## Important Notes

-  **Permissions:** You may need elevated permissions (root privileges) to run the script, especially if your operating system has restrictions on access to file systems.

-  **File Access:** Make sure the USB drive is connected and files can be copied.

- **Stop the script:** You can stop the script by pressing `Ctrl + C` on the keyboard.
